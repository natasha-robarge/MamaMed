# MamaMed
MamaMed is a Google Voice assistant app for assisting low income pregnant females. The patient can say how they are feeling, and their response will be recorded on a dashboard for their doctor to view that is updated with live data. The live data can help the doctor make further diagnosises and know what's going on that could affect the baby and the mother.
